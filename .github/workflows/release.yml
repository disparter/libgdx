    # and https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request
    # for more information on this event
    # and its different properties and types.
    # Note that `pull_request.merged` is not available in the `closed` event
    # so we need to filter the events using the `pull_request.closed_at` property
    # and checking if it is greater than the `pull_request.merged_at` property
    # See https://github.community/t/pull-request-merged-event-for-actions/17133/7
